# InTideScat_JGR

Analysis scripts (python and jupyter notebook) and source files for producing the results presented in the paper by Lahaye et al, "Internaltide cycle and scattering over the North Mid-Atlantic Ridge".

Model simulations performed with CROCO (https:www.croco-ocean.org)

`python_roms_modules` contains some of thespecific modules called in the scripts. 

Note that these scripts are mostly working/draft versions, and tightly linked to the type of intermediate dataset I was using in my processing chain. 
It is therefore very unlikely one will be able to re-use it, and the python capabilities leveraged in these scripts are mostly outdated. 

That being said, feel free to contact me for any question.
